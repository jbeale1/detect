Experiments with object detection and localization

For example, with the Yolo v3 DNN code from https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
For the first time, object detection with useful accuracy is feasible even CPU-only on a small system
Runs on Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GB RAM, taking about 3.5 seconds per image with the full YOLO-v3 network.
